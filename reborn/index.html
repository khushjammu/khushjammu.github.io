        <p>My name is Khush. I'm a high-school student by day and developer by night. I was born in Malaysia, lived in Hong Kong for a few years, and now live in Singapore. I'm love programming, philosophy, and reading! I'm doing some development consulting work on the side too, and I'm excited to see how that goes.</p>

        <h2 id="who-am-i">What's my story?</h2>
        <p>I was born in Malaysia, where I spent my formative years. I moved to Hong Kong when I was nine years old. Between adjusting to a new school and trying out Hong Kong‚Äôs food, I developed an interest in programming after reading <i>Stealing the Network</i>.</p>
        <p>Then I moved to Singapore. In Grade 9, I met two people who would come to be very important to my journey: <a href="https://taichikato.com">Taichi</a> and <a href="https://www.aryavohra.com/">Arya</a>. We hit it off immediately and ended up winning a hackathon together with Questo: an app that generated simple fill-in-the-blank questions from pictures of a textbook page.</p>
        <p>Around that time I met a senior whom I really respect, who was about to graduate in my high-school. In many senses, he was a role-model for all three of us and he encouraged us to pursue our interests. Between that and reading Cal Newport‚Äôs <i>How to Be a High School Superstar</i>, I decided to start treating HS as a day job and maximise the amount of free time I have to do my own thing. </p>
        <p>I've used that time to win hackathons, build cool stuff with Taichi and Arya, gym, and read. Along the way, my friends have got me into Anderson .Paak and older Kendrick. (<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0YF8PfcGbsKg5IaFyPnlyY?si=sI0oG1kNQ8-neJMpOxnYhQ">Ventura</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/748dZDqSZy6aPXKcI9H80u?si=e5N8wF-LTrCouFrOt1wVYg">good kid, m.A.A.d city</a> are my favourites.)</p>
        <p>So yeah, that‚Äôs me. I‚Äôm graduating high-school in just under a year and I can‚Äôt wait to see what comes next. I love meeting cool people so if you wanna do anything from geek out over a book to chat about a cool project, hit me up!</p>
