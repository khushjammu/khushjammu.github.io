        <p>Crime and Punishment (C&P) is a novel by Russian Author Fyodor Dostoyevsky first published in 1866. It was written after his five-year exile in Siberia, telling the story of Rodion Raskolnikov, an impoverished student who formulates a plan to kill an old pawnbroker, does the deed, and pays the price in every sense of the word.</p>
        <p>This is, without even the slightest of a doubt, the most intimate book I’ve ever read. There’s something ethereal about Dostoyevsky’s writing that so masterfully manages to merge the voice of the narrator and the consciousness of Raskolnikov into one intricately wound thread. Take the following monologue from the first chapter:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>“I want to attempt such a thing, and at the same time I'm afraid of such trifles!' he thought with a strange smile. 'Hm...yes...man has it all in his hands, and it all slips through his fingers from sheer cowardice...That is an axiom...I wonder, what are people most afraid of? A new step, their own new word, that's what they're most afraid of...I babble too much, however. That's why I don't do anything, because I babble. However, maybe it's like this: I babble because I didn't do anything. I've learned to babble over this past month, lying in a corner day in and day out, thinking about...cuckooland. Why on earth am I going now? Am I really capable of that ? Is that something serious? No, not serious at all. I'm just toying with it, for the sake of fantasy. A plaything! Yes, a plaything if you like!”</p>

        <p>Raskolnikov’s diatribe here perfect personifies both his diseased mind and yet also how Dostoyevsky manages to build such a connection between him and us. Observe the syntax of the dialogue, somewhat disjointed with an underlying thread of reasoning that unifies it all. The form is curiously reminiscent of a dramatic monologue, in that we learn far more as readers about the state of any one character’s mind from insight into their thoughts as opposed to direct characterisation. What’s so enthralling about this book is that there seems to be some supernal unison between the narration and our mind, a perspective so warped that we cannot help but see ourselves in him.</p>

        <p>Aside from the intimate proximity between the reader and the characters, Raskolnikov is a tantalising character. Bitterly arrogant and wrought with moral anguish, he is undoubtedly someone we would all hate to bump into in the street, but that we come to love by the end of the book. With a transformation so stunning and redemption in the denouement of the novel so fitting, he brought real tears to my eyes. I’ll leave it to you to guess whether I mean Dostoyevsky or Raskolnikov. I can only give this as a hint (as the inner flap of my translation puts it so aptly): his only hope for redemption lies in the virtuous and faithful Sonya.</p>

        <p>And then there’s the philosophy so deeply entrenched in this book’s thought. I wasn’t expecting it when I first started, but there is a surprising amount of very surprising philosophical rumination in this book. Dostoyevsky explores the effect of crime on the criminal through Raskolnikov and his struggle with guilt and horror, the nature of evil through the detestably depraved Svidrigailov, and the purpose of society’s punishment in the context of redemption. The fact that Raskolnikov’s mental afflictions are parallel to his physical ailments seem to suggest that crime, and the blight on conscience, are both similar in terms of being almost an illness, adding a new dimension of meaning to the word ‘diseased’ when describing him. His indirect references to his intended crime by saying “that” alludes volumes.</p>

        <p>But what I found most profound about the book, is how Dostoyevsky seems to be suggesting that the real crime of Rodion Raskolnikov was believing that he, or anyone, could be above the law and that the real punishment was that which he inflicted on himself, and his conscience. I won’t say much about the role of religion in C&P except to draw attention that Orthodox Christianity is widespread among Russians and, some might say, is core to their identity.</p>

        <p>All in all, this is a book that simultaneously defies and fulfils all the expectations I had of it. The fact that the murder took place in the first chapter confounded me at first: everything I had heard about this book, by reputation, seemed to suggest that it was about how a man struggles with himself after committing a crime; how could the crime be given such scant attention? On reflection, I see that my reaction was precisely what Dostoyevsky wanted to achieve — the real object of this book isn’t the crime Raskolnikov commits, but rather is the moral crisis that follows it. The final few pages, too, evoked the same reaction from me. I initially found it ending on such a religious note out of character when compared to the previous six sections, but upon rereading certain key moments, Dostoyevsky’s evolution of religion as a source of comfort makes a lot of sense given how religion is portrayed as being the source of strength for Sonya. In both cases, there was a complexity initially missed that, once grasped, was like hearing the gentle harmony of musical notes in tune.</p>

        <p>As for challenges, the only significant one I faced when reading C&H was that there are many different forms of people’s names in Russian, and Dostoyevsky uses them interchangeably, which got me a bit confused at the start. With that said, I did get used to it by the end of the second section. The somewhat disjointed dialogue too necessitated more careful reading, though that turned out to be a blessing in disguise: I appreciated the book so much more! I’ll end this review with one of my favourite quotes from the book: “When reason fails, the devil helps!”.</p>
