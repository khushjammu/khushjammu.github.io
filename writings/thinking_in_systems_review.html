        <p>This is a really nice introduction to systems and the field of systems analysis. Meadows' writing is clear and concise, with excellent diagrams to help supplement her points. Her style of writing has this quality of being so clear that it's almost as if, despite being involved in such a quantitative field, she actually thinks in prose. All the ideas she talks about are introduced and developed without any mathematics being involved. (Though, should you wish to pursue it she's included it in her appendix!)</p>

        <p>The book is subdivided into three parts, and each of those parts has a distinctly different feel to it. The first, "System Structure and Behaviour", serves as an introduction to the basic concepts of flows, stocks, and feedback loops that are so fundamental to the field. The terminology used is beautifully precise — meaningful yet always lucid. I quite liked her "Systems Zoo", where she used a bunch of examples to illustrate how dynamic and unpredictable systems can be. This part was primarily informative.</p>
        
        <p>The second, "Systems and Us", begins her transition into a more profound discussion of the nature of systems and our interactions with them. The part on "System Traps... and Opportunities" was probably my favourite in this section — wonderfully insightful as to how those traps can be seen in our daily lives.</p>
        
        <p>The third and final, "Creating Change—in Systems and in Our Philosophy", is the culmination of the book and is the most philosophical and thoughtful of them all. Her rumination on how we can leverage certain aspects of a system to drive change segues seamlessly into a more metaphysical discussion of the nature of systems and what a systems "view of the world" implies for the wielder.</p>
        
        <p>Before reading this, I don't think I understood just how much systems thinking permeates throughout our world. I still don't. But I couldn't help but notice how concepts she mentions I've seen in other forms. The concept of responsibility in a feedback loop she so casually remarks on was the subject Nassim Nicholas Taleb's Skin in the Game; the concept of a resilient system reminiscent of Taleb's other book Antifragile; the idea of evolutionary systems in our social conduct from the Selfish Gene; the idea and consequences of the idea that humans are systems was explored in a similar fashion in Ray Dalio's Principles. What an awesome book!</p>
