        <p>'God Bless You, Mr Rosewater' is the fourth Vonnegut book I've read and as so many other reviewers have pointed out, it was magical. It tells the intwined stories of Eliot Rosewater, the seemingly-crazed millionaire by inheritance, with that of the ruthlessly greedy Norman Mushari in a format familiar to anyone who's read Cat's Cradle — a series of loosely connected short stories that come together to provide compelling yet absurd narrative so characteristic of Vonnegut.</p>
        
        <p>With his trademark sardonic humour, this is the novel that finally made it clear to me his reputation as being the bleakest writer and yet the most optimistic humanist. In sharp contrast to his depictions in other books, Kilgore Trout makes his first appearance here, along with the Tralfamadorians. As the back of my copy puts it so splendidly: "It is the story of a millionaire's lunacy, the obsessions of a famous family and the collective madness of a nation."</p>

        <p>I couldn't agree more.</p>
