        <p>I love reading. I managed to pick up the habit when I was very, very young. I'm not sure how it happened, but I'm glad it did. Books are a way for me to escape my sometimes mundane reality and inhabit a completely different world.<label for="sn-kooky-books" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="sn-kooky-books" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">This sounds a bit kooky, but I stand by it.</span>  It's also an awesome (<a href="https://andymatuschak.org/books/">maybe</a>) way to learn things!</p>

        <p>Currently, I'm reading <i>The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea</i> by Yukio Mishima.</p>

        <h2>My Favourite Fiction</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><i>Crime and Punishment</i> by Fyodor Dostoyevsky
            <ul>
              <li>I loved this so much I wrote a long-form review of it. You can find it <a href="/writings/cp_review.html">here</a>.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><i>The Belgariad</i> and <i>Mallorean</i> series by David Eddings
            <ul>
              <li>I have a very strong sentimental attachment to this series. They've always been there at my side whenever younger me needed some respite from the upheavel of moving. In many ways, I feel a strong affinity and peculiar fondness for Garion: I feel like his journey out of the farm in Sendaria to become King of the West and eventually slay the Dragon God Torak in many ways, though perhaps not literally, mirrors every young boy and girl's childhood: there comes a time when we're wrest unwillingly from our innocence and have responsibility thrust upon us. Like Garion, we can all find it overwhelming sometimes. But like Garion, we can overcome it.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><i>Shōgun (Asian Saga, #1)</i> by James Clavell
            <ul>
              <li>One of the most beautiful novels I've ever read. It shows us the interplay between a bold English adventurer, a mastermind Japanese warlord, and a woman torn between two ways of life. Clavell's use of narrative perspective is amazing, and the ending alone makes the whole book worth it. 
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><i>Mother Night</i> by Kurt Vonnegut
            <ul>
              <li>I read somewhere that Vonnegut is somehow humanity's greatest cynic and its most feverent humanist. I only really understood that after reading this novel. The oxymoronic Nazi with good intentions explores the hipocrasy in war and the human psyche. 
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><i>God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater</i> by Kurt Vonnegut
            <ul>
              <li>My favourite Vonnegut novel! I wrote a short-form review of it. You can find it <a href="/writings/mr_rosewater_review.html">here</a>.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><i>The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea</i> by Yukio Mishima
            <ul>
              <li>At once confounding and enchanting, Mishima weaves a tapestry of post-war Japan imbued with his own spirit of artistic perfection and hunger for glory. I'm studying this in my literature class at the moment, and it's so satisfying to gradually understand that which was once incomprehensible.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>My Favourite Nonfiction</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><i>Thinking in Systems: A Primer</i> by Donella H. Meadows
            <ul>
              <li>A wonderful introduction to systems thinking. The writing is clear and Meadows has a knack for making even the hardest concepts easy to understand — it's a testament to both her expertise and writing. I wrote a long-form review on it. You can find it <a href="/writings/thinking_in_systems_review.html">here</a>.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><i>How to Win Friends and Influence People</i> by Dale Carnegie
            <ul>
              <li>The reason I love this book, despite the crummy title, is simple: it taught me that all you need to have friends is to be yourself. I had just moved to Singapore and was feeling a little lonely — I didn't quite fit in as much as I'd have liked. But this book taught me that it wasn't about trying to fit in, it's about just being yourself. The people come after.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><i>The Selfish Gene</i> by Richard Dawkins
            <ul>
              <li>An excellent introduction to the theory of evolution! Dawkins somehow makes a rather sober topic surprisingly intriguing by writing almost as a detective would. The back (or maybe the front) of the book says that somehow, it's almost as if Dawkins thinks entirely in prose, which is impressive given how mathematical evolutionary biology can be. 10/10 worth the time.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><i>How to be a High-School Superstar</i> by Cal Newport
            <ul>
              <li>This book was incredibly formative on my approach to school and, now, college admissions. In a single sentence: follow what interests you, fuel your curiosity, and reach far. Everything else will come. My kind of jam. 
          </li>
        </ul>
