        <p>I love reading. I managed to pick up the habit when I was very, very young. I'm not sure how it happened, but I'm glad it did. Books are a way for me to escape my sometimes mundane reality and inhabit a completely different world.<label for="sn-kooky-books" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="sn-kooky-books" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">This sounds a bit kooky, but I stand by it.</span>  It's also an awesome (<a href="https://andymatuschak.org/books/">debatably</a>) way to learn things!</p>

        <h2>My Favourite Fiction</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><i>The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea</i> by Yukio Mishima
            <ul>
              <li>At once confounding and enchanting, Mishima weaves a tapestry of post-war Japan imbued with his own spirit of artistic perfection and hunger for glory. I'm studying this in my literature class at the moment, and it's so satisfying to gradually understand that which was once incomprehensible.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><i>Shōgun (Asian Saga, #1)</i> by James Clavell
            <ul>
              <li>One of the most beautiful novels I've ever read. It shows us the interplay between a bold English adventurer, a mastermind Japanese warlord, and a woman torn between two ways of life. Clavell's use of narrative perspective is amazing, and the ending alone makes the whole book worth it. 
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><i>Mother Night</i> by Kurt Vonnegut
            <ul>
              <li>I read somewhere that Vonnegut is somehow humanity's greatest cynic and its most feverent humanist. I only really understood that after reading this novel. The oxymoronic Nazi with good intentions explores the hipocrasy in war and the human psyche. 
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><i>God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater</i> by Kurt Vonnegut
            <ul>
              <li>My favourite Vonnegut novel! I wrote a short-form review of it. You can find it <a href="/writings/mr_rosewater_review.html">here</a>.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><i>Crime and Punishment</i> by Fyodor Dostoyevsky
            <ul>
              <li>I loved this so much I wrote a long-form review of it. You can find it <a href="/writings/cp_review.html">here</a>.</li>
