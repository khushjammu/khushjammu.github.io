              <h1>Khush Jammu</h1>
              <p>My name is Khush. I'm a high-school student by day and developer by night. I was born in Malaysia, lived in Hong Kong for a few years, and now live in Singapore. I'm interesting in programming, philosophy, and reading!</p>

              
              <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p>I was born in Malaysia, where I spent my formative years. I moved to Hong Kong when I was nine years old. Between adjusting to a new school and trying out Hong Kong‚Äôs food, I developed an interest in programming after reading Stealing the Network.</p>
                <p>Then I moved to Singapore. In Grade 9, I met two people who would come to be very important to my journey: Taichi and Arya. We hit it off immediately and ended up winning a hackathon ‚Äî IBM‚Äôs PitchIT ‚Äî together with Questo: an app that generated simple fill-in-the-blank questions from pictures of a textbook page.</p>
                <p>Around that time I met a senior whom I really respect, who was about to graduate in my high-school. In many senses, he was a role-model for all three of us and he encouraged us to pursue our interests. Between that and reading Cal Newport‚Äôs High-School Superstar, I decided to start treating HS as a day job and maximise the amount of free time I have to do my own thing. </p>
                <p>And it worked! I‚Äôve managed to get decent grades with a ton of free time, and I‚Äôve used that time to win hackathons, build cool stuff with Taichi and Arya, hang out with my girlfriend, gym, read. Along the way, my friends have ruined my music taste with Anderson .Paak and older Kendrick, damn them. (Seriously though, Ventura is sexy.)</p>
                <p>So yeah, that‚Äôs me. I‚Äôm graduating high-school in just under a year and I can‚Äôt wait to see what comes next. I‚Äôm trying out development consulting so let‚Äôs see how that goes. I love meeting cool people so if you wanna do anything from geek out over a book to chat about a cool project HIT ME UP.</p>
                <p>‚úåÔ∏è</p>

                  ‚Üí a way for me to effect change in what I see is a broken aspect of education ‚Äî an emphasis on retention of facts and the such. received $120,000 in subsidised cloud funding from Google Cloud and IBM. currently running a beta. have spent 3yrs++ working on it (since I was in Grade 9).
                  </ul>
                </ul>
                <ul>Saturn 
                  <ul>

                    </ul>
