        <p>I was born in Malaysia, lived in Hong Kong for a bit, and will graduate from high-school in Singapore soon. I love building things, reading philosophy & old books, and playing the guitar.</p>
        <p>When I was 12, I read Stealing the Network: a collection of semi-fictional short stories about hackers. Younger me was mesmerised by the power and leverage technology offers — the first ever program I wrote was a tool from that book. From then on, I became student by day, developer by night.</p>
        <p>In high-school, I met <a href="https://taichikato.com">Taichi</a> and <a href="https://www.aryavohra.com/">Arya</a>. Together, we've won hackathons, worked on our startup Questo, hosted our own events, snagged government grants, and more. Those late-night calls with them are some of my best memories. I've grown and done far more than I could have on my own. I'm very grateful to be friends with them.</p>

        <p>Now, I'm graduating high-school. I have two years of compulsory national service before I go to university. That's two years of runway to do whatever I want to. I hope to meet more awesome people, start development consulting, and keep building stuff. Feel free to hit me up!</p>

        <h2 id="stuff-done">In the past I've...</h2>

        <h3>Built Things</h3>
        <ul>
    	  <li id="kafka"><b><a href="https://github.com/questoai/kafka">Kafka</a></b>: the first-ever implementation of dependency parsing on iOS. I built it with Taichi and Arya as a proof-of-concept that it was possible to use CoreML to perform dependency parsing. Writeups coming soon.</li>
          <li><b><a href="https://questo.ai/">Questo</a></b>: generate study materials in a snap. It was a way for me to fight our education system's emphasis on memorising facts. $120k in cloud funding from Google and IBM. <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/questo">Product of the Day</a> with 500+ upvotes and 140+ upvotes on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16637415">HackerNews</a>.</li>
          <li id="bookworm"><b><a href="https://devpost.com/software/bookworm-aye8z5">Bookworm</a></b>: an app that uses AR to augment the experience of reading a book. We hung a camera over a book, such that you could click any word and it would appear on a companion app.</li>
          <li id="photonify"><b><a href="http://getphotonify.mystrikingly.com/">Photonify</a></b>: a photography assistant that helps you take better photos by guiding your composition. (Press: <a href="https://www.gic.com.sg/news-and-resources/startup-weekend-singapore-swsg-mega-2017-winners-announced/">1</a> <a href="https://perspectives.uwcsea.edu.sg/community-news/hacking-their-way-top-grade-10s-win-startup-weekend-singapore-2017">2</a> <a href="http://communities.techstars.com/singapore/singapore/startup-weekend/11281">3</a> <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/startup-weekend-singapore-hackathon-gets-over-100-ideas">4</a> <a href="https://www.sgsme.sg/news/localised-travel-chatbot-wins-two-prizes-startup-weekend-singapore-hackathon">5</a>)</li>
          <li id="fendir"><b><a href="https://github.com/khushjammu/fen.dir">Fen.Dir</a></b>: a Python utility for finding undervalued guitar listings on Carousell and Reverb. I built this with Arya when I was starting guitar, and almost fell prey to gear-fever. I made it out alive (and not broke) with this to show for it.</li>
          <li id="hequals"><b><a href="https://devpost.com/software/hequals-h">h=</a></b>: an AI powered human resource manager without bias. It assigns tasks to people in a team based on pure meritocratic skill, thus avoiding bias. (Press: <a href="https://perspectives.uwcsea.edu.sg/community-news/uwcsea-teams-win-technopreneurship-gender-equality-codeathon">1</a>)</li>
          <li id="submap"><b><a href="https://github.com/khushjammu/submap">Submap</a></b>: a simple DNS subdomain bruteforcer written in Python, based on a tool I read about in a book. It was my first real programming project! I thought I had lost the code until very recently I rediscovered the repo.</li>
          <li id="saturn"><b>Saturn</b>: a moonshot attempt at creating a web app which could generate courses to learn anything. It didn't work out because we couldn't figure out how to aggregate knowledge graphs. If we were to do it again, I'd start by manually making them.</li>
          <li id="wheremyflight"><b><a href="https://github.com/khushjammu/wheremyflight">Where my Flight??</a></b>: a React Native app that lets you search for any flight flying in/out of Changi Airport. I built it because iChangi is garbage.</li>
          <li id="polaroid"><b>Polaroid</b>: a React Native app that uses <a href="https://github.com/lengstrom/fast-style-transfer">Fast Style Transfer</a> to make your photos resemble famous artwork. Because it was submitted as coursework, I cannot release the code yet.</li>
          <li id="climate"><b><a href="https://github.com/khushjammu/climate">Climate</a></b>: a reproduction of an infographic from The Economist using P5.js.</li>
          
        </ul>

        <h3>Won Hackathons</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Best Pre-U Hack @ Hack & Roll 2019</b><label for="sn-hacknroll-context" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label> (~230 participants)
            <input type="checkbox" id="sn-hacknroll-context" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Hack&Roll is Singapore's biggest youth hackathon with sponsors like Google, Visa, and Jane Street. It just so happened that 2019 was our third year participating — third time's the charm!</span>
            with <em><a href="#bookworm">Bookworm</a></em>. We drew the largest crowd there, what with the camera <a href="https://challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/743/391/datas/original.jpg">dangling scarily</a> and all. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Pre-U Winning Team @ #codeathon 2017</b> (~80 participants) for $500 cash with <em><a href="#hequals">h=</a></em>. We flew to Kuala Lumpur from Singapore to participate!
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Most Creative Prize @ SWSG Mega 2017</b> (~250 participants) for $40k in prizes with <em><a href="#photonify">Photonify</a></em>. We got literal wows when demo-ing on stage, which was awesome. Even cooler, a photo of me making history notes on stage became a <a href="https://imgur.com/CJ8bYjg">meme</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Written Things</h3>

          <li>A 50+ page research paper comparing BERT and XLnet on a variety of NLP tasks. It was submitted as coursework, so I need to wait until July before I can upload it.</li>
          <li>A <a href="https://medium.com/the-artificial-intelligence-journal/hot-coqa-and-marshmallows-an-intro-to-stanford-s-new-qa-dataset-in-3-min-7bb3d5a40128">short introduction</a> to the Stanford CoQA dataset.

          <li>An <a href="https://medium.com/the-artificial-intelligence-journal/hot-coqa-and-marshmallows-an-intro-to-stanford-s-new-qa-dataset-in-3-min-7bb3d5a40128">explanation</a> of the paper for Google's HDRnet</li>
