I'm a high-school student by day and developer by night. I was born in Malaysia, lived in Hong Kong for a few years, and now live in Singapore. I'm love programming, philosophy, and reading!</p>\n\n\t      \n\t\t<h2>Who am I? (~2min)</h2>\n\t\t\t<p>I was born in Malaysia, where I spent my formative years. I moved to Hong Kong when I was nine years old. Between adjusting to a new school and trying out Hong Kong’s food, I developed an interest in programming after reading Stealing the Network.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Then I moved to Singapore. In Grade 9, I met two people who would come to be very important to my journey: Taichi and Arya. We hit it off immediately and ended up winning a hackathon together with Questo: an app that generated simple fill-in-the-blank questions from pictures of a textbook page.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>Around that time I met a senior whom I really respect, who was about to graduate in my high-school. In many senses, he was a role-model for all three of us and he encouraged us to pursue our interests. Between that and reading Cal Newport’s High-School Superstar, I decided to start treating HS as a day job and maximise the amount of free time I have to do my own thing. </p>\n\t\t\t<p>And it worked! I’ve managed to get decent grades with a ton of free time, and I’ve used that time to win hackathons, build cool stuff with Taichi and Arya, hang out with my girlfriend, gym, read. Along the way, my friends have ruined my music taste with Anderson .Paak and older Kendrick, damn them. (Seriously though, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/0YF8PfcGbsKg5IaFyPnlyY?si=sI0oG1kNQ8-neJMpOxnYhQ\">Ventura</a> is sexy.)</p>\n\t\t\t<p>So yeah, that’s me. I’m graduating high-school in just under a year and I can’t wait to see what comes next. I love meeting cool people so if you wanna do anything from geek out over a book to chat about a cool project HIT ME UP.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>✌️</p>\n\n\n\t\t<div className=\"social\">\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/khushjammu\">Twitter</a></p>\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16637415\">LinkedIn</a></p>\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16637415\">Stackoverflow </a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t        \n\n\n\n\n\t\t<h2>What I’m doing now ({\"<1min\"})</h2>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>Working on Questo (see below for info)! 📚</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Reading <i>Range</i> by <i>David Epstein</i> 📖</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Getting into development consulting 🤓</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Preparing to release a new flight app (stay tuned 😉) 🛫</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Thinking about how I’m going to spend my years in NS (Singapore’s mandatory two-year national service) and beyond 👮‍♂️</li>\n\t\t\t</ul>\n\n\t\t<h2>My Favourite Books ({\"<1min\"})</h2>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Doteyevsky 🔪 (my review <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2806596992\">here</a>)</li>\n\t\t\t<li>The Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov 👺</li>\n\t\t\t<li>God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater by Kurt Vonnegut 💸 (my review <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2793644728\">here</a>)</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Principles by Ray Dalio 📏</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Thinking in Systems: A Primer by Donella H.
